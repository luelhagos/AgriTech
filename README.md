# AgriTech - USGS LIDAR Challenge
## Business Need
At AgriTech, we are very interested in how water flows through a maize farm field. This
knowledge will help us improve our research on new agricultural products being tested on
farms.
How much maize a field produces is very spatially variable. Even if the same farming
practices, seeds and fertilizer are applied exactly the same by machinery over a field, there
can be a very large harvest at one corner and a low harvest at another corner. We would
like to be able to better understand which parts of the farm are likely to produce more or
less maize, so that if we try a new fertilizer on part of this farm, we have more confidence
that any differences in the maize harvest 9are due mostly to the new fertilizer changes, and
not just random effects due to other environmental factors.
Water is very important for crop growth and health. We can better predict maize harvest if
we better understand how water flows through a field, and which parts are likely to be
flooded or too dry. One important ingredient to understanding water flow in a field is by
measuring the elevation of the field at many points. The USGS recently released high
resolution elevation data as a lidar point cloud called USGS 3DEP in a public dataset on
Amazon. This dataset is essential to build models of water flow and predict plant health and
maize harvest.
